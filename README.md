# AutoML-with-Streamlit

A fork github repo for learning purpose.

<br>

Since the libraries version and python version has some problem while directly running the fork repo, I have perform some modification on the python version including the libraires version.

<br>

**Some modification i made:**
- Python==3.7         &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;    *(for pycaret casting problem at "Modeling" part)*
- altair==4.0.0       &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;    *(for v4 problem while running app.py)*
- streamlit==1.23.0   &emsp;                *(for import dataset problem)*
- Change library pandas_profiling -> ydata_profiling  &emsp;&emsp;   *(pandas_profiling no longer been used)*

<br>

Basically,
1. Create virtual environment with Python 3.7, can use conda.
2. Install the correct version of libraries
